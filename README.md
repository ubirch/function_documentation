# function_documentation

This repo is pushed to automatically using a **Github Action** from other Ubirch repos.

The documentation that beforehand was generated with **Doxygen**, is then published using **Github Pages**.

For an example take a look at the [ubirch-protocol-python function-documentation](http://developer.ubirch.com/function_documentation/ubirch-protocol-python/).
